The anisotropic Kuwahara filter is a generalization of the Kuwahara filter that avoids artifacts by adapting shape, scale and orientation of the filter to the local structure of the input. Due to this adaption, directional image features are better preserved and emphasized.<br> This results in overall sharper edges and a more feature-abiding painterly effect.

<h3><font color="yellow">Attention</font></h3>
The current version does not guarantee even minimal operation.<br>
It has only been tested on the Windows version of DaFusion where CUDA is available; it will not work with OpenCL.<br>
Additionally, there is a possibility of unknown problems even in a CUDA environment.<br>
Also note that it is not fully optimized and is very slow.
